||Notes

TSF allows browser to run ML models without interacting with backend
    great for privacy
    not ideal for training new models
        import * as toxicity from "@tensorflow-models/toxicity";

Client-side ML text models
    Content-based clustering
    Text highlighting
    Emoji recommendation

Supervised learning: use pre-labeled data set to train model
    then classify content based on model weights
    e.g. universal sentence encoder converts sentences to numbers using deep neural network

Issues
    unintended ML bias, lower accuracy



||Brainstorming

Looking at point on screen
    highlight text
    recommend e-commerce products
        user-based vs item-based
        k-means clustering

Facial expression
    input emoji
    suggest websites/ songs/ playlists/ videos/ images

Voice to text 
    translator

Browser history
    recommend websites
