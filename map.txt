    Background script

        Event handler
            navigate to new page
            remove bookmark
            close a tab

        Only loaded when needed and unloaded when idle

    UI elems

        Browser action 
            Users can always interact with extension
            Icon, tooltip, badge, popup

        Add pages 
            Popups
            tabs.create or window.open() to display HTML files

        Context menu
            Right click images/ hyperlinks/ pages

        Omnibox
            Register a keyword with Chrome's address bar
            Each keystroke is sent to extension, option to provide suggestions in response

||Notes

TSF allows browser to run ML models without interacting with backend
    transfer learning- great for privacy (explain to user in terms of service)
    not ideal for training new models
        import * as toxicity from "@tensorflow-models/toxicity";

Client-side ML text models
    Content-based clustering
    Text highlighting
    Emoji recommendation

Supervised learning: use pre-labeled data set to train model
    then classify content based on model weights
    e.g. universal sentence encoder converts sentences to numbers using deep neural network

Issues
    unintended ML bias, lower accuracy



||Brainstorming

+ Develop ML in browser and retrain existing models

+ Universal sentence encoder for NLP tasks

    +Spellchecker/ autocorrect/ suggestions everywhere
        grammatical error correction
            recommendations based on user data

    +Morphological segmentation on highlight

    -textual similarity

    -multimodal sentiment analysis (images, video, text)
        emotions 
        polarity, trends of public opinion/ marketing
    

    


+Looking at point on screen
    highlight text
    recommend e-commerce products
        user-based vs item-based
        k-means clustering

+Browser history
    recommend websites

+Data vis 
    how much time the user spends doing X
        types of websites
        types of activities
        how long they were online (over a day, week, month)



-Voice to text 
    translator
    
-Facial expression
    input emoji
    suggest websites/ songs/ playlists/ videos/ images
